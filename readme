Maido code:

fun1 need to be revised for release
discard fun2 because some library not invoked
fun3 also has some functions not been invoked with proper library




Xiaoyi code:

discard fun1 because for loop is too slow
testing fun 2 and 3


my:
modifying fun1 based on maidou's fun1 -> done
fun2 use xiaoyi -> done
fun3 use mix/xiaoyi
